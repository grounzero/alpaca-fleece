# Memory Log - 2026-02-08

## Critical Lessons from Today's Session

### 1. NEVER Touch Code Directly
**Reinforced:** I must ALWAYS spawn python-dev for any code changes, linting, formatting, or test fixes. No exceptions.

### 2. CI/CD Is Iterative
When CI fails on linting/formatting:
- Fix one issue at a time
- Be patient with version differences (local vs CI)
- Each fix gets its own commit
- Don't try to batch fixes

### 3. Files That Should NOT Be in Source Control
- OpenClaw workspace files: AGENTS.md, BOOTSTRAP.md, HEARTBEAT.md, IDENTITY.md, SOUL.md, TOOLS.md, USER.md
- Memory files: MEMORY.md, memory/*.md
- Runtime logs: nohup.out
- Internal agent directives

These belong in workspace root, not the project repo.

### 4. Black Formatting Version Mismatches
CI black version may differ from local, causing repeated formatting failures on the same files. The solution is iterative fixing, not trying to get it perfect in one go.

### 5. Pre-commit Hooks Save Time
Setting up pre-commit hooks (ruff, black, isort) catches issues before CI, saving CI minutes and preventing broken commits.

**Enforcement:** These rules are absolute - no exceptions.
